# Blockchain Blackjack

Currently, Bitcoin blackjack accounts for a large portion of all blockchain gambling transactions. Most BTC casinos feature at least one Bitcoin blackjack game and there are numerous ways to play and win. Although blackjack is known as one of the most complex card games, people have been known to win it using specific strategies.

Bitcoin blackjack is complicated, especially for a beginner. Just like anything else, it is possible to get better at it with practice. However, this depends on the player and how much practice is put into it. Almost every game has a strategy, which is basically a roadmap of steps, taken to beat opponents. In the case of Bitcoin blackjack, this basic strategy was formulated using a computer simulation of multiple blackjack hands.
Although these simulations are deeply rooted in mathematics, and may show a user how to better optimize their hand to beat the card dealer, there is no certainty that it will work for every player. Each action a player should take is shown to them in a simple way. For example, a basic strategy may tell a player when to double down or when to split, in order to win the hand.

## Implementation

The entire implementation part is taking part in Go. The rules of the game were written so that any newcomer has to sign with its wallet via an external port to the hosting service. Upon complying, the players place their initial bets in order to play. 

For this purpose, a new proof-of-work blockchain was written to support the functionalities of blackjack.
